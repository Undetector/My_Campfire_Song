# My_Campfire_Song
Underneath the moon's soft light, we roam,
By the crackling fire, we find our home.
In nature's embrace, we're never alone.
Finding new faces in the dark,
Fogetting the reason that we roam,
Entranced by the unseen spark,
Losing our way, never returning home,
The fires catch us, never leaving a mark.
